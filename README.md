## General Info
The project was initialized to create a work day planner application. The application needs to include the current date in the header of the page. There are also time blocks available for the standard business hours of the current date. The time blocks for that day are also color coded to show if the time is in the past, present or future visually to the user. The user may add and save data into the planner and come back to reference it at a later time, make changes and save again if desired.
* The user is able to manage their time effectively and accurately with this planner
* The user may save, edit, and review previous entered data even after leaving the page
* It is easy to see what day it is from the large header text.
* Future time blocks are colored green, present time blocks are red, and past time blocks are white.
